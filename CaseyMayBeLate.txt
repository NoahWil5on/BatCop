I might be late. If I am I should be there by 10:30 at the latest.

Try to get the AI "finished" enough to test it against the sonar.

See if we can apply some materials to the environment and if the sonar will show them properly. 

I had an idea to use a newspaper as our tutorial and narrative vehicle. If the team likes that look up some newspaper layouts, 1940s style may be a good option if you can find that, and start planning layout.

I apologize for my lateness.
